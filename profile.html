                    I grew up in Bethesda Frankel Estate Church, as my parents were Christian. Throughout my teens I took the reponsibility to be serious about my faith, and tried my best to grow. I was baptised on the 14th of December, 2014. I have found many of my good friends in church and they are really great people. I found that I have really grown over the years and I'm thankful for that.</p>

                    I attended Geylang Methodist School (Primary) during my primary years. I did very well throughout Primary 1 - Primary 4, mainly thanks to my parents being strict yet graceful in my studies. However, I wish I did not take their authority for granted as I got too playful and did not focus on my studies. I still did well for PSLE, however, I do wish I had put more effort in my studies. Nonetheless, I do not regret anything, as it paved the way to where I am now. I graduated with a PSLE T-Score of 229.</p>

                    Although I was originally posted to my primary school affliate, Geylang Methodist School (Secondary), Mr Goh, the vice-principal of St. Andrew's Secondary School at that time, interviewed me for my appeal and immediately accepted me into his school. I was very grateful as this allowed me to join my good friend, Khoo Zhenyu, at this all-boys school. Both of us joined the Boys' Brigade, as a continuation from our primary school Co-Curricular Activity (CCA). There, I learnt many important lessons such as the qualities of leadership, discipline and such. While I was very involved in the Boys' Brigade, I also learnt to balance my time well for my studies in Secondary 3 and 4. I took my 'O' Levels in November 2015, doing decently well with a raw L1R5 of 15 and L1R4 of 12.</p>

                    When I was Primary 4, I joined the 21st Junior Boys' Brigade in Geylang Methodist School (Primary), primarily because my father was an old BB Boy and he had told me many great stories about his time there. I had lots of fun in the Junior section, and when I went to St. Andrew's Secondary, I continued on to the 7th company.
                    <br> In the 4 years of my secondary school, I really learnt alot from my seniors and officers and grew very close to my batchmates - thanks to the many training camps we were through together. I learnt alot about leadership and was given responsibilities such as Games I/C, Squad Leader and have been a committee member of many events and even chaired my own event. I am really thankful for the opportunities I had to grow and to learn in my four years.
                    <br> At the end of my four years, I took up the challenge to go back to serve after graduation as a Primer, which is my current position in the 7th Company. I hope to grow and learn more, while juggling with my studies and my other CCAs.

                    After attending DMIT (School of Digital Media &amp; Infocomm Technology) Club's Freshman Orientation Camp (FOC) 'Aftermath' before my new poly life started, I really grew to love the people and the seniors there (even though I could only go for two out of four of the camp days). I then became very committed to the club, regularly going to the club room (mainly to do my schoolwork) and to their events. This gave me the opportunity to really bond with my seniors and batchmates.
                    <br> When they were interviewing for Year 1 Subcommittee members, I decided to join to contribute back to the club. I was then given a position under Publications, which was mainly managing social media to announce upcoming events. This gave me the opportunity to learn many new things such as Adobe Photoshop and Lightroom. I'm really thankful for my Publications family 'The Baristas', which consists of my two main committee members Abigail and Joseph, and my fellow subcommittee members Jamie, Vera and Syafiqah.
                    <br> Being in the club also gave me the opportunity to join Organising Committees and help out other events. Currently, I am in the design team for Escape Room, which will be held in January 2017. I am also part of the next year's FOC camp planning committee. I am very grateful for the opportunities I had through DMIT Club and for the wonderful people there.

                    When I joined Singapore Polytechnic, I initially wanted to join football as I loved it and wanted to join a CCA that can improve my fitness. However, I did not pass the try outs. Hence, I decided to take Krav Maga, which was a very interesting "martial art" (it's not really a martial art, it's more of a self-defense class).
                    <br> At Krav Maga, I made quite good friends with some of my batchmates as well as the seniors in the committee. I found myself improving my techniques and loving the classes that were held every Tuesdays and Thursdays. I am aiming to go for my P1 grading in January 2017.

                    I love football. I got into football when I was in Primary 4, as my friends were all playing and watching football. However, I did not really follow any single team. I was just playing both the game FIFA and in real life with my friends.
                    <br> In Secondary 1 &amp; 2, my classmates were also very much into football. We played every single day during recess and we had lots of fun. There, I trained to be a defender and a goalkeeper - primarily being a defender.
                    <br> When I changed classes in Secondary 3, my classmates were similar - however we only played during our Physical Education classes instead of playing everyday during recess. I trained and developed as a goalkeeper throughout Secondary 3 &amp; 4, and my classmates were really supportive and rated my ability.
                    <br> I became a fan of Arsenal F.C.when I was Secondary 4, as I loved the style of their game and the players they had. I've been watching their matches whenever I can. I find myself being very passionate about the club and hope they win the premier league this season!
